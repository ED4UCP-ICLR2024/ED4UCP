# ED4UCP

This repository is for the double-blind review only. The foldering of the files needs correction, which will be done after review (to get a run, you should put `compare_trees.py` and `evaluationutils.py` into a folder named `evaluation`, and all the other files except `single_eval.py`, `averaging.py`, and `experiments.py` into a folder named `library`). `averaging.py` is the actual code that performs the ensemble method. `experiments.py` contains functions and commented scripts corresponding to the paper's experiments. `single_eval.py` takes two trees and computes the f1 score.

Also, proper refactoring and adding more information about how to make the whole thing work will take place afterward. This is not done now as the work uses a lot of previous work codebases, requiring some preprocessing and postprocessing, which explaining them may reveal the author's identity (to some specific persons, but who knows who the reviewer is :D) based on past communications.
